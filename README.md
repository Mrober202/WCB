Cakebook for Waracle by Michael Robertson.

the app was built in sublime using the MERN framework for React.

The app can be started by runnin npm run start-dev in terminal.

it uses Mongodb, Express, ReactJs and Node, the database is hosted on mLab for Mongodb.

a break down of each aspect used:

Axios: to use HTTP methods to communicate with the database.

Express: provide a framework to set up the Node.js server.

Body Parser: parse the incoming requests bodies for the info being sent.

Foreman: to boot up the API and webpack-dev-server simultaneously.

Nodemon: watches the server.js file for changes, then restarts it.

Marked: to convert markdown syntax to html.

Mongoose: abstracts away the MongoDB boilerplate for a simple Schema solution.

I built the app for previous projects i had worked on at codeclan but i had only covered some of React backend so using the online documentation and some examples i filled in the gaps that didnt have knowledge of.

the app allows users to input certain info based on the spec, the update and delete buttons allow the user to update or delete as expected.
